# giF0S_Project

This project aims to integrate the prior knowledge of
layout with the fundamentals of programming learned in this
module.

The challenge will be to develop a catalog of GIFs that will include
search functionality, interaction with an external API and capture of
video.

We can start by creating a basic folder structure for
keep all our files in order. Next we must
create the structure of our html, without forgetting to link all the
important resources, including scripts, fonts, and style sheets.

In the project requirements we are also asked to implement two
different styles that the user can select from a menu, that is
important that we take this into account when styling.

Having this initial structure we can proceed with the layout of the
site, preparing the bases to add functionality more
ahead.

The objective of the project is to replicate a labor scheme of a
Front-End Developer, so the design must be the same as
reference.
