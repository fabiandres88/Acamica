# podcast_Project

This project proposes you the challenge of building a static website
Responsive using only HTML and CSS code.
To complete it, you are going to layout the web of a podcast on the subject
that you like the most, applying all the knowledge you incorporated about
HTML and CSS.
From the site you will be able to listen to real podcasts that will be
embedded together with images and text related to their content.

As a first step you are going to create a directory with the name of your
project, and within it the necessary structure to contain so
organized the files that compose it.

1. Create the directory. It is recommended not to use symbols or
special characters in the name.

2. Create the index.html file inside the project directory, with
the basic structure of an HTML 5 document.

3. Create the images and styles resource subdirectories, within the
main directory.

4. Download the images from the prototype resources and add them
to the images directory.

5. Create the styles.css file and add its path to the <head> of
index.html, along with that of the Font Awesome and Font library
Awesome Brand Icons. We recommend using the options
CDN to avoid including additional files to the project.
  
6. Download the fonts indicated in the resources
from Google Fonts and import them into the styles.css file or
add them to the <head> of index.html.
  
7. Add the style rules that you want to apply to all
elements of your project using the selector *.
We recommend removing margins, paddings, and borders.

8. Add the <title> tag inside the <head> in index.html with the
name of your site.
